#break and continue
#the difference between while loop and for loop

#break -->get out of the loop(only the loop the keyword is in)
#continue-->go back to the control mechanism

for a in range(1, 31, 1):
    if (a==13):
        continue
    print(a)
    

#FOR LOOP MAKE SURE THAT INCREMENT/DECREMENT IS THE LAST THING TO HAPPEN
