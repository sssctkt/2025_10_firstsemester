#break and continue
#the difference between while loop and for loop

#break -->get out of the loop(only the loop the keyword is in)
#continue-->go back to the control mechanism
a=1
while a<31:
    if (a==13):
        
        continue

#FOR LOOP MAKE SURE THAT INCREMENT/DECREMENT IS THE LAST THING TO HAPPEN
