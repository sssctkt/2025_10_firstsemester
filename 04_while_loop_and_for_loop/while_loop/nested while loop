"""
so far you know
basic while loop (you are expecting something to happen to break the loop)
basic for loop (how many iteration to run)
while (true) //go forever
break--get out of the loop (most inner loop)
continue--skip the rest , go back to the loop control mechanism

for loop make sure that the last thing to happen is the increment/decrement
