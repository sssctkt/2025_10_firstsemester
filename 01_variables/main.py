#variable--to store and manipulate the value
# = (assign value from RIGHT TO LEFT)
#example
#rules on creating variables
#2.1=number (wrong)

#1. it has to be one phrase
zoe_and_kirpa=34
seth_and_ali=17
#2. number cannot go first
#3x=21
x3=21
print(x3)
#3. Do not use keyword as your variable name
#print=45
#print(print) NO

#below is the suggestion on how to create a good
#variable name

#1. try to keep it in lowercase
#2. instead of creating something like x1234=25
#be more indicative radius=25
