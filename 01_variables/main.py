#Can a variable in python change its storing type?

#short answer: yes

number=123
number=number+4
print(number)


number="this is a sentence!"
number=number+3

print(number)

#long answer: while you can change change of a variable
#please (at least in class) do not do it
#because you are making it way more confusing in doing so

#what if you need another type?? Simply create another variable
#while the value of the variable can be changed. Try not to change the type
