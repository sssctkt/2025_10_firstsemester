#logical confusion
#why do we need elif and else??

#please remember, elif and else, you pick one and discards the others

#let's do a not obvious example first

ph=int(input("Enter the ph level"))

if (ph<=2):
    print("it's very acidic")
if(ph<7):
    print("acidic")
    
#always use if and elif
